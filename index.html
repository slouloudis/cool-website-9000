    <p>Alright, so here’s the deal: My dad, Heihachi, decided to throw me off a cliff when I was a kid. Real nice, right? Anyway, I survive—thanks, Devil genes!—and spend the next couple of decades plotting revenge. Heihachi organizes this "King of Iron Fist Tournament," and I’m like, perfect, free ticket to punch him in the face. I fight my way through a bunch of weirdos (a bear? Seriously?) and finally beat him. Then I toss him off a cliff. Revenge served cold. But here’s the kicker: I may or may not have enjoyed it way too much. Oops.</p>
